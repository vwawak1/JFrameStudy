# JFrame
Originally a repository to hold the source files for a small test snake game.  
After realizing that JFrame isn't the best for this idea I might continue this in a Python env.  
For now, I will use this to study and mess with various JFrame utilities.  

## Finished  
- Created First JFrame
- Added title, metadata to Frame, and a button to transition to a game frame

## Todo  
- Add Icon for application
- Fix title orientation
